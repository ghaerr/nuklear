check clipping if working, printf in nano-X server
make resize realloc buffer in window
invisible cursor
add scrollwheel handling
cursor move seems slow
	trying to move NX window doesn't work well
add image handling
rename xlib_ routines etc

bug: mouse down works only in small area?

Add GrSetLineAttributes API
consider adding NXDrawArc routines into nano-X
